# STOCK PRICE PREDICTION 📈 

A data-driven project that demonstrates how machine learning algorithms can be applied to historical stock market data to predict future prices. In this case, we analyze and forecast Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock using various regression techniques.

## 🧠 About the Project

This project aims to:
- Understand stock price movement through data analysis
- Perform time-series feature engineering
- Train different machine learning models to predict closing stock prices
- Evaluate the performance of each model and visualize the results

We use **supervised machine learning algorithms** such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor to predict Apple's stock price based on historical data.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for ML modeling and evaluation

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `AAPL.csv.zip`, a zipped CSV file containing historical data of Apple Inc. stock. It includes:

- `Date`
- `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close` prices
- `Volume`

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA section includes:
- Line plot of stock closing prices over time
- Volume vs Price correlation
- Data cleaning (handling missing values)
- Feature extraction (targeting next-day price prediction)

---

## 🤖 Modeling and Evaluation

We apply and compare the following models:
1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Decision Tree Regressor**
3. **Random Forest Regressor**

### Metrics Used:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R² Score**

The models are evaluated based on their ability to predict the next day's closing price using historical patterns.

## 🚀 📊 Results
The Random Forest model typically outperforms the other two in terms of prediction accuracy and generalization. The notebook includes plots comparing actual vs predicted values.
Sample Output:
- Linear Regression: Higher bias, low variance
- Decision Tree: Good fit but risk of overfitting
- Random Forest: Balanced performance, lower error metrics

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Include LSTM/GRU (deep learning models) for time-series forecasting
- Add more financial indicators like RSI, MACD, etc.
- Automate hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV or Optuna
- Deploy the model as a REST API using Flask or FastAPI
- Integrate live stock data using financial APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance)
